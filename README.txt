Parlor Ghost Games dialogue tool
- written by Taylor Cunningham -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
-------------
- Create a node by entering its traits in the form to the right
- The first node will have no parent, as it is the root node
- Each node after the root node must have one parent, and each node may have multiple children
- Click on the node names in the list on the left-hand side to view that node
- You may edit any traits of the selected node except for its parent
- You may import a JSON file using the file input element at the bottom right of the screen. It will overwrite whatever you're working on.

Buttons
-------------
Clear Web Storage - This will erase all of the nodes you've entered.
Add a node - This will clear the form to let you add a new node.
Delete node - This will delete the node you are currently viewing, as well as its children
Download - Download a .json file that can be used in our game to create dialogue!  The filename will use the Conversation Name input like so: <Conversation Name>.json
